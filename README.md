## Background

As a product manager with no prior development experience, I wanted to solve a real problem I encountered daily - sharing web content in a more elegant way. Using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) and spending less than an hour, I built my first Chrome extension. This project represents my journey from PM to developer.

## Features

- One-click selection of web content
- Automatic generation of sharing cards with:
  - Original website metadata
  - Source URL QR code
  - Selected content display
  - Clean, modern design
- Easy sharing options

## Technical Implementation

Built using:
- Chrome Extension APIs
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- QR Code generation library
- Web scraping for metadata

Key functionalities:
1. Content selection and capture
2. Metadata extraction
3. QR code generation
4. Card template rendering
5. Sharing interface

## Installation

1. Download source code
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the project directory

## Development Journey

This project demonstrated that with modern AI coding tools like Cursor, product managers can bring their ideas to life without extensive coding background. The key was breaking down the product into clear technical requirements and leveraging existing APIs and libraries effectively.
